# Sales Analysis with Python Pandas & Matplotlib

This project aims to analyze three years worth of sales data using Python Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to answer specific business questions.

## Overview

The dataset contains thousands of store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. Through data analysis, we address the following key business questions:

1. What is the overall sales trend?
2. Which are the Top 10 products by sales?
3. Which are the Most Selling Products?
4. Which is the most preferred Ship Mode?
5. Which are the Most Profitable Category and Sub-Category?

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Imported necessary libraries.
   - Loaded the sales dataset.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas to gain insights into sales trends.
   - Visualized sales trends over time using Matplotlib.
   - Identified top-selling products and analyzed their performance.

3. **Answering Business Questions:**
   - Determined the overall sales trend by analyzing monthly sales data.
   - Identified the Top 10 products based on sales volume.
   - Identified the most selling products based on quantity sold.
